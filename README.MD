## Server
The server sets up a WiFi access point with SSID "test" and password "test1234", making it accessible to nearby client devices. It configures a static IP address (192.168.1.1) on its own network with port 8888 for client connections2. This configuration allows any client device to connect directly to the ESP8266 without requiring an external router or internet connection.

When a client connects, the server turns on its built-in LED to visually indicate an active connection. The server implements a simple keep-alive mechanism where it responds to any client message with either "Keep alive" or "Keep alive and Open" depending on the state of a physical button connected to pin D57.

The timeout functionality (5000ms) ensures that if no activity is detected from the client within the specified period, the connection is terminated. This prevents half-open connections that could consume resources unnecessarily.

## Client
This ESP8266-based system automates a garage door using an ultrasonic sensor and WiFi connectivity. It first establishes a connection to a predefined WiFi network and verifies the serverâ€™s MAC address before proceeding. Once connected, it communicates with a server to authenticate access. The ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) measures distance, triggering LEDs based on proximity. If an object is detected within a certain range, the system prepares to open the door. The garage door operates based on received commands and distance measurements. If the correct authentication is received from the server and the object is close enough, the door opens and remains open for a set duration before closing automatically. If the device disconnects from WiFi, the door closes immediately for security reasons. Additionally, the system maintains a keep-alive mechanism by periodically sending signals to the server. If authentication fails or there is no response within a timeout period, the ESP8266 restarts to ensure stable operation. This mechanism ensures secure, automated, and reliable control of the garage door using a combination of WiFi authentication and distance sensing.
